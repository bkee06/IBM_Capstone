        "To analise the potential locations for drone delivery hubs based on proximity to playgrounds and subsequently select the highest rated Coffee Shop in each cluster to approach for a colaboration. \n",

        "# Background:\n",
        "My client has approached me with a business proposition to start a drone delivery company in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia. \n",
        "\n",
        "The initial stage will be market research and a proof of concept, hence they would like to deliver a single product that is highly consumable and small. \n",
        "\n",
        "To reduce initial risk and aid in ease of delivery, large open areas would be preferable for delivery locations. \n",
        "\n",
        "# Proposal:\n",
        "Product - I have suggested coffee is a product that is easy to produce, small and has high consumption rates. \n",
        "\n",
        "Delivery Zones - As Canberra has a large amount of public open space spread though out the populated area I have suggested that local playgrounds would provide a good delivery zone. \n",
        "\n",
        "Colaboration - To ensure customers participate in the initial trial a well recognised brand that is local and highly regarded in each location is required. \n",
        "\n",
        "# Datasets:\n",
